    <p>Our purpose is to provide a simple and easier way for registered users to plan and keep track of their Workouts
    throughout the month. If you want to get started
    <p>
        To get started, users can use our calendar to select a date they would like to work out.
        Once a date is selected, users can select from our list of workouts that inclued: pullups, pushups, and running
        users will be able to choose how much of the selected workout they want to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the month goes on and workouts are being completed, signed in users can then keep track
        of their progress through our tracker app. The tracker app will graph your progression throughout
        the month and serve as a mental motivator to our clients once they see their progress improves.
